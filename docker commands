some docker and flask commands


# To get inside running container
docker exec -it b56fa0d76d5c bash
	
# Hitting flask API in POST
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST -d '{"input_file_path":"inputs/Store_POS.csv"}' http://localhost:5000/autoEDA

# To create requirements.txt using pipreqs package
pipreqs /user/flaskAPP          # /user/flaskAPP is the folder containing the scripts for whome you want to generate requirements.txt
pipreqs /user/flaskAPP --pypi-server http://infynp.ad.infosys.com/repository/pypi-all/simple      # Using custom proxy server

# To build from Dockerfile when Dockerfile is in current directory. dot(.) signifies current directory
docker build . -t "name_of_image"
docker build . -t flaskapp:latest     #name:version


# Run container having flask APP
docker run -p localhost:5001:5000 image_id
	
	localhost is not necessary. you can use 5001:5000 only also
	-d which detatches from the run. This means you wonâ€™t see any output. 
	   You can remove the -d if you would like to see the run process.
	-p which specifies the port it is going to run on
